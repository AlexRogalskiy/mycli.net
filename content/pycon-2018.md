Do you love colorful, terminal applications?

Are you going to Pycon this year?

You can't afford to miss the DBCLI booth at PyCon.

We are an OpenSource org that builds commandline database clients with modern
features. Auto-completion, syntax highlighting and friendly UI.

[DBCLI](https://www.dbcli.com) is the umbrella org that builds
[mycli](https://www.mycli.net), [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com), and
[mssql-cli](https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli) projects.

* [mycli](https://www.mycli.net) - A better MySQL terminal client with auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
* [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com) - Postgres commandline client with auto-completion and syntax highlighting.
* [mssql-cli](https://github.com/dbcli/mssql-cli) - MSSQL commandline client with auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

This year (2018) we are qualified as an OpenSource sponsor for PyCon. We will
have a booth and will be showing demos of mycli, pgcli and mssql-cli at the
booth. The core devs from all the projects will be available to answer
questions and help you get setup if you're interested. 

Engineers from Microsoft who built the mssql-cli will also be hanging out in
the booth to show you the awesome features of the tool.

If you are curious to find out why you should use these tools instead of the
default clients, swing by our booth. We'll be happy to convince you why these
tools are awesome!

**We have stickers and t-shirts. Above all we're a bunch of Python geeks who'd love
to shoot the shit with you.**
