Title: Faq
Slug: faq

1. **How did it all begin?**

    Earlier this year I wrote [pgcli](http://pgcli.com) to scratch my own itch.
    I realized that most of the work that went into that project was not
    specific to Postgres database. I received a few requests from MySQL users
    requesting a MySQL equivalent of pgcli. I kept procrastinating for a few
    months and finally decided to launch a kickstarter campaign to fund the
    development time. That's this project came into existence. But if you'd
    like to know why I bothered to write a auto-completing repl with syntax
    highlighting, here's the reason:

    I'm a huge fan of CLIs. Especially REPLs. When I first encountered
    [BPython](http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/), I fell in love with it.
    BPython is a Python REPL that has auto-completion, syntax-highlighting and
    displays the docstring of functions as you type. Once you get used to that
    level of pampering, all other REPLs start to look like [Dumb
    Terminals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Dumb_terminals). 

    When I started using psql for interacting with my Postgres database, I
    yearned for a BPython equivalent for psql. 

    One fine day I got a twitter DM from [Jonathan
    Slenders](https://github.com/jonathanslenders) asking me if I'd be
    interested in trying a new Python library that he's working on called
    [Python-Prompt-Toolkit](https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit).
    This library provided a way to write CLIs without having to deal with
    ncurses and had the requisite tools for doing auto-completion and
    syntax-highlighting. So I jumped at the opportunity to try it out. After I
    got myself familiarized, I started writing pgcli to scratch my own itch. 
   
    So this app exists because Jonathan was kind enough to request my feedback. 

1. **Does mycli work on Windows?**

    Yes! I have personally tried it on Windows and it does work. But the
    unit-tests are not run on a Windows environemnt. So if things break please
    [report](https://github.com/dbcli/mycli/issues) them and I'll fix it asap.

1. **Will there be an equivalent of this for Sqlite/Postgresql?**
   
    There is already an equivalent for Postgres. Checkout: [http://pgcli.com](http://pgcli.com)
    
    I don't have time to write an SQLite version. But if you're
    interested in doing it, I'd be happy to help you. Please get in [touch]({filename}/pages/6.about.md).

1. **How is the Smart Completion implemented?**

    Smart Completion uses the [Sqlparse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlparse)
    library to tokenize the sql statement and uses heuristics to suggest
    context sensitive completion. It can handle nearly 80% of scenarios (in my
    testing). But there are still some corner cases where it will suggest only
    keywords when you might be looking for columns or tables. So it could get
    frustrating when it refuses to provide completions from a different
    category. In those scenarios, I tend to turn it off (using the F2 key) and
    switch to Naive completion which suggests words from all categories.

    Writing auto-completion libraries are inherently difficult since you're
    dealing with incomplete input. Since the parser can't work effectively in
    many scenarios, the code has to compensate for those corner cases. Which
    resulted in a lot of testing and patching those cases with one off
    'if-conditions'. 

1. **What is the license for mycli?**

    BSD 3-clause license. https://github.com/dbcli/mycli/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
   
1. **How can I get support for pgcli?**

    There is a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mycli-users) 
    and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dbcli/mycli) chat. We also track our bugs
    and feature requests in [Github Issues] for this project. 

1. **I found a bug, what do I do?** 

    Whoopsie Daisies! I'm sorry you encountered a bug. Please file a bug on
    [Github Issues] for this project. I'll fix it asap.

1. **I have a feature request, what do I do?** 

    Sweet! Open a new item on [Github Issues]. Alternatively, you can take a stab
    at implementing the new feature yourself. If you'd like some guidance, I'm
    just an email away. Don't hesitate to [contact] me.

1. **I want to contribute to this project, how do I do that?** 

    Awesome! I thought you'd never ask. Here's a [developer
    guide]({filename}/pages/develop.md) that provides basic info on getting
    started with local development. You're also welcome to [contact] me, if you
    need some help getting started.
    
1. **What's your favorite cuisine?** 

    What's the point in having an FAQ if I don't include at least one frequently
    asked question. So here it goes: 

    South Indian, North Indian, Thai, Mexican, Mediterranean, Ethiopian,
    Japanese, Chinese, Sandwiches, Salads. In that order.
