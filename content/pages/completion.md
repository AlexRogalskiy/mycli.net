# AutoCompletion

Auto-completion is on by default. The REPL will pop up a suggestion menu as soon as you start typing. The suggestions are context sensitive based on the position of the cursor. eg: Only tables are suggested after the FROM keyword, only column names are suggested after the WHERE clause.

## Smart Completion

I call this context sensitive suggestion as smart completion. Here are a few examples of smart completion.

### Table

Only table names from the current database are suggested after the FROM keyword.

### Alias

Aliases in the query are resolved and the columns from the table aliases are suggested.

## Fuzzy Match

The completions are matched using a [fuzzy algorithm](http://blog.amjith.com/fuzzyfinder-in-10-lines-of-python). For example typing 'djmi' will match the table 'django_migrations' because 'djmi' has parts of matching substrings. Here's an example:
