Slug: install

# Compatibility:

Tested on OS X and Linux. Runs on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and 3.4.

Works well with unicode input/output.

# Python Package:

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can do:

You might need ``sudo``. 

    :::bash
    $ pip install mycli

    or 

    $ easy_install mycli


# Mac OS X:

The easiest way install ``mycli`` in an OS X machine is to use [homebrew].

    :::bash
    $ brew install mycli

# Linux:

### Debian/Ubuntu Package:

The debian package for `mycli` is hosted on [packagecloud.io](https://packagecloud.io/).

Add the gpg key for packagecloud for package verification.

```
    $ curl https://packagecloud.io/gpg.key | apt-key add -
```
    
Install a package called apt-transport-https to make it possible for apt to fetch packages over https.

```
    $ apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
```

Add the mycli package repo to the apt source.

```
    $ sudo echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/amjith/mycli/ubuntu/ trusty main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Update and apt sources and install mycli.

```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install mycli
```

Now `mycli` can be updagraded easily by using ``sudo apt-get upgrade mycli``.

### RHEL, Centos, Fedora:

I haven't built an RPM package for mycli yet. So please use `pip` to install `mycli`. You can install pip on your system using:

```
    $ sudo yum install python-pip
```

Once that is installed, you can install mycli as follows:

```
    $ sudo pip install mycli
```
