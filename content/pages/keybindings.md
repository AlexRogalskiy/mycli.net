Slug: keybindings
status: hidden

There are two types of keybindings available. Emacs mode and Vi mode. The keybindings can be changed via the config file (~/.myclirc) or toggled via F4 key.

Emacs mode is the default. In emacs mode you can type Ctrl-a to go to the beginning of a line and Ctrl-e to go to the end of a line and many more. 

When Vi mode is enabled you can use modal editing features offered by Vi in the REPL command line.
