## <a name="logging"></a>Logging

There are two types of logging. 

1. Operational logs are on by default and stored in the home folder as ~/.mycli.log. This is useful for debugging mycli. It is useful if you're developing mycli, but not so useful for end users.

2. Audit logs can be optionally turned on using a command line option `-l`. This will log every command and it's output with a timestamp. This is useful for keeping track of every command and it's output during a session.
