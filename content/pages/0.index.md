Quick Start

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:

If you're on OS X you can install it via homebrew. Just be aware that this will
install postgresql via homebrew if you don't already have it.

   $ brew install pgcli

If you're having trouble with the quick start, check the [install][install] page for
detailed instructions.
