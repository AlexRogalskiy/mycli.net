Title: History and Search
Slug: history
status: hidden

MyCli keeps track of the queries entered in the repl. Up/Down arrow can be used to navigate the history. 

Pressing <C-r> will enable incremental history search. So press <C-r> and then
start typing your search term to see the queries narrowed down. You can cycle
through the matches by pressing <C-r> again.
